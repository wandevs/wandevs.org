title: Differences between Wanchain and Ethereum
---

Since Wanchain started as a fork of Ethereum, it shares much of the same
structure and features as Ethereum. However, Wanchain adds two new key
features.

* Wanchain supports cross-chain transactions
* Wanchain supports privacy transactions

These features, and the need to make Wanchain distinct from Ethereum, required
a couple changes in the core stucture that developers need to take into
consideration when building Dapps.

### Txtype Field Added to Transaction

To facilitate privacy transactions a new field has been inserted in the transaction format called `Txtype`. This field can currently contain two values:

* 0x01 for normal transactions
* 0x06 for privacy transactions

This change, although quite small, has a big impact on libraries that create transations.

### Change in Address Checksum

The checksum of an Ethereum address was introduced by Vitalik in [EIP-55](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md).
To minimize the risk of collisions between Ethereum and Wanchain addresses, the checksum was changed. This ensures that when using checksummed addresses the chances of accidentally using a Wanchain address on Ethereum and vice versa is minimized.


The checksum calculation for Ethereum looks like this:

```js
exports.toChecksumAddress = function (address) {
  address = exports.stripHexPrefix(address).toLowerCase()
  var hash = exports.sha3(address).toString('hex')
  var ret = '0x'

  for (var i = 0; i < address.length; i++) {
    if (parseInt(hash[i], 16) < 8) {
      ret += address[i].toUpperCase()
    } else {
      ret += address[i]
    }
  }

  return ret
}
```

The checksum calculation for Wanchain is changed to instead:

```js
exports.toChecksumAddress = function (address) {
  address = exports.stripHexPrefix(address).toLowerCase()
  const hash = exports.sha3(address).toString('hex')
  let ret = '0x'

  for (let i = 0; i < address.length; i++) {
    if (parseInt(hash[i], 16) >= 8) {
      ret += address[i].toUpperCase()
    } else {
      ret += address[i]
    }
  }

  return ret
}
```

So basically convert the address to hex, but if the ith digit is a letter (ie. it's one of abcdef) print it in lowercase if the 4\*ith bit of the hash of the lowercase hexadecimal address is 1 otherwise print it in uppercase.

### Change in Wallet Keyfile

The wallet file for Wanchain is different from an Ethereum wallet.

}
```

As you can see above there is another object called `crypto2` as well as a `waddress` entry. The `waddress` is your private address and the `crypto2` object contains the second private key needed to create the one-time addresses associated with the privacy transactions. The wallet is backwards compatible with Ethereum though, so you could use a Wanchain wallet on both Ethereum and Wanchain.
