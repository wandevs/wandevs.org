## Solidity Experience

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the EVM. Solidity is compiled to bytecode that is executable on the EVM. With Solidity, developers are able to write applications that implement self-enforcing business logic embodied in smart contracts. 

Solidity shares many similariliraties with Javascript and is considered an easy and quick language to grasp. Currently most decentralized applications that have been deployed utilize Solidity and we expect this trend to continue. Below we provide a list of third party resources which can help in your quest to learn this language
